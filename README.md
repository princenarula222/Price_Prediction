Implementation of univariate linear regression using MATLAB

There are two models. One model utilizes the gradient descent optimation algorithm. Other model utilizes the normal equation for optimization. 

1. To train and test the gradient descent model, run grad_desc_model.m.

2. To train and test the normal equation model, run norm_eq_model.m.

You may modify the training and test sets as per your need.
